    <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
    <p id='personal-statement'>
             Kame grew up in the heart of the desert, where she endured the influence of pastoralism that shaped her early life.
             The shifting climate patterns posed numerous challenges to her traditional way of life as the world around her changed. 
             The shift from a pastoral existence to agriculture prompted her to see life from a different perspective. Witnessing the
              impact and challenges her community faced, Kame, a software developer, is passionate about using technology to integrate
             the Internet of Things. This will enable farm monitoring and automated irrigation systems to ease their new way of life 
             and improve crop yield.

    <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
    <p id='personal-statement'>
    Blockchain technology holds immense, yet often underutilized potential in 
    revolutionizing supply chains. Despite its capabilities to enhance transparency,
     security, and efficiency, many industries are yet to scratch the surface of what 
     blockchain can offer. By providing a decentralized ledger for immutable transaction
      records, blockchain facilitates trust and real-time tracking of goods across complex 
      networks. Cynthia aims to integrate blockchain into supply chain management to harness
       its potential, streamlining logistics and fostering innovation fully. She envisions a 
       future where blockchain is the backbone of supply chain operations, setting new industry standards.
